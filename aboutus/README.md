## The Hevnly dev team ##
Here are the people that make Hevnly tech happen.

### Hector (JavaScript) ###

### Mario (Node.js) ###
Mario is hevnly's javascript ninja. He codes server side apps using node.js and hapijs. He writes automated tests using mocha-js just to make sure he only delivers rock solid code. If there's a problem, then he'll code a solution. In his free time, Mario enjoys coding javascript for a change.

He's also a stripper in a night club to raise money for charity.

### Chris (Devops) ###

### Leandro (PHP) ###
Leandro is the go-to guy when it comes to PHP and anything to do with our VM. He's our in-house backend magician, seamlessly juggling multiple tasks and problems which our hevnly dev's teams constantly throws at him. He's a great source of knowledge when it comes to all things software, both front-end and back-end.

It's all good with Leandro, as long as you don't mention Boca Juniors.

### Mat (UI/UX) ###

Mat closes the gap between design and code. His passion is in UI/UX however he understands that good design can be lost when converting this into code and so buffers the gap between them. He is all about the "quantifiable self" and has all sorts of metrics about his life.
